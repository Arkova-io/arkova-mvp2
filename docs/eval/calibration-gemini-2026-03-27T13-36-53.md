## Recalibration Recommendations

- Pearson r = 0.000 (target >= 0.80). Confidence scores do not reliably predict accuracy.
- ECE = 16.6% — expected calibration error is high. Model is generally underconfident.
- Bucket 0-20%: underconfident by 16.6pp (reports 0% confidence, actual 17% accuracy).
- PROMPT FIX: Add instruction "Your confidence scores are 17pp lower than actual accuracy. Be more confident in your extractions."
